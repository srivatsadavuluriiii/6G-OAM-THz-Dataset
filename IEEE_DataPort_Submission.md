## Abstract

The 6G OAM THz Dataset presents the first comprehensive, physics-based repository specifically designed for Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beam communications in sub-Terahertz frequencies (300-600 GHz) for 6G wireless systems. This dataset comprises 270,000 high-fidelity samples with perfect validation quality, featuring 33 comprehensive physics parameters across eight critical domains: atmospheric turbulence, weather environment, fading and channel characteristics, pointing and alignment, OAM beam physics, hardware impairments, propagation physics, and performance metrics.

Generated through rigorous physics-based simulations, the dataset covers four deployment scenarios—lab controlled (70K samples), indoor realistic (80K samples), outdoor urban (70K samples), and high mobility (50K samples)—providing complete coverage from controlled environments to wide-area applications. Each sample incorporates realistic atmospheric modeling, hardware impairments, and environmental conditions, achieving throughput ranges of 0.1-1000 Gbps, latency performance of 0.011-2.841 ms, and SINR coverage from -30 to +50 dB.

This dataset is fully compliant with 6G requirements and ITU-R IMT-2030 frameworks, enabling advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning applications for next-generation wireless communications. Primary applications include multi-agent network optimization, dynamic beam steering control, adaptive power allocation, and interference mitigation strategies.

## 1. Introduction

The evolution towards 6G wireless communications demands unprecedented data rates exceeding 100 Gbps, ultra-low latency below 1 millisecond, and energy efficiency improvements of 100x over current 5G systems. These ambitious targets necessitate exploration of new frequency bands, novel antenna technologies, and advanced signal processing techniques. The sub-Terahertz (sub-THz) frequency range (300-600 GHz) combined with Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) beam multiplexing presents a promising solution for achieving these goals.

This dataset addresses the critical gap in comprehensive, physics-based data for 6G system design and optimization. Unlike existing datasets that focus on limited scenarios or simplified models, our repository provides complete end-to-end system modeling with realistic atmospheric effects, hardware impairments, and environmental conditions.
